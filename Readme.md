# Installing Remote VS Code
As I familiarized myself with coding on the Rasp Pi, I got frustrated with Debugging.  I'm trying out using VS Code over ssh, following the steps outlined [in this blogpost](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudioCodeRemoteDevelopmentOverSSHToARaspberryPiIsButter.aspx).
- Set up ssh on the Rasp Pi so that it doesn't need a password.  I followed the instruction in [this post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudioCodeRemoteDevelopmentOverSSHToARaspberryPiIsButter.aspx).
- Installed [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha).  Whew - this doesn't clobber VS Code.  It is another separate app.
